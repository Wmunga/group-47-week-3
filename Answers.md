### Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?
**A:**  
- **TensorFlow** uses static computation graphs (with eager execution as an option), is widely adopted in production, and has strong deployment tools (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow Serving).  
- **PyTorch** uses dynamic computation graphs, making it more intuitive for research and prototyping.  
- **Choose TensorFlow** for production-ready, scalable solutions and mobile deployment.  
- **Choose PyTorch** for rapid prototyping, research, and when flexibility is needed.

### Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.
**A:**  
1. **Interactive Experimentation:** Jupyter Notebooks allow data scientists to iteratively test code, visualize results, and tweak models in real time.
2. **Documentation & Sharing:** Notebooks combine code, output, and markdown, making them ideal for sharing experiments, tutorials, and reproducible research.

### Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?
**A:**  
spaCy provides advanced NLP features like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing, which go far beyond basic string operations (e.g., splitting or searching text). It is faster, more accurate, and easier to use for complex language tasks.

## 2. Comparative Analysis

**Scikit-learn vs. TensorFlow:**

- **Target Applications:**  
  - **Scikit-learn** is best for classical machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, clustering) and small to medium-sized datasets.
  - **TensorFlow** is designed for deep learning, neural networks, and large-scale data, supporting both research and production environments.

  - **Ease of Use for Beginners:**  
  - **Scikit-learn** is highly beginner-friendly, with a simple, consistent API and excellent documentation. It is easy to quickly build and evaluate models.
  - **TensorFlow** has a steeper learning curve, especially for those new to deep learning, but high-level APIs like Keras have made it more accessible.

- **Community Support:**  
  - **Scikit-learn** has a strong, active community, especially in academia and industry for classical ML tasks.
  - **TensorFlow** has a large global community, extensive resources, and is widely used in both research and production for deep learning.
